In production, it is recommended to minify any JavaScript code that is included with your application.
Minification can help your website load several times faster, especially as the size of your JavaScript source code grows.

Here's one way to set it up:

    Install Node.js
    Run npm init -y in your project folder (don't skip this step!)
    Run npm install terser

Now, to minify a file called like_button.js, run in the terminal:

npx terser -c -m -o like_button.min.js -- like_button.js

--to start react project
npm rm -g create-react-app
npm install -g create-react-app
npx create-react-app my-app

browserify meta.js -p esmify > signed_new.js
